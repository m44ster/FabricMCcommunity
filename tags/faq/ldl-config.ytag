    title: Configuring LambDynamicLights

---

To access LambDynamicLights configuration screen, please install Mod Menu from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu). Mod Menu is more reliable than the "Video Options" settings menu.
 Alternatively, Sodium users can also press Shift+P on Sodium's Video Options screen to access Minecraft's Video Settings.
